      <h2>NYC's Boroughs</h2>
      <h3>Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island</h3>
      <p>
        All five boroughs came into existence with the creation of modern New
        York City in 1898, when New York County, Kings County, part of Queens
        County, and Richmond County were consolidated within one municipal
        government under a new city charter. All former municipalities within
        the newly consolidated city were eliminated.

      <h2>Attractions</h2>
      <h3>World Trade Center</h3>
      <p>
        The building occupies a 200-foot square, with an area of 40,000 square
        feet , nearly identical to the footprints of the original Twin Towers.
        The tower is built upon a 185-foot tall windowless concrete base,
        designed to protect it from truck bombs and other ground-level attacks.
        The current base cladding consists of angled glass fins protruding from
        stainless steel panels, similar to those on 7 World Trade Center. LED
        lights behind the panels illuminate the base at night. Cable-net glass
        fa√ßades on all four sides of the building for the higher floors,
        designed by Schlaich Bergermann, will be consistent with the other
        buildings in the complex.

      <h3>The Statue Of Liberty</h3>
      <p>
        The statue is a figure of Libertas, a robed Roman liberty goddess. She
        holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand
        carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776 in
        Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A
        broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she walks forward,
        commemorating the recent national abolition of slavery. After its
        dedication, the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United
        States, seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.
      </p>
      <h3>Central Park</h3>
      <p>
        Central Park is an urban park in New York City, between the Upper West
        and Upper East Sides of Manhattan. It is the fifth largest park in the
        city, covering 843 acres (341 ha). It is the most visited urban park in
        the United States, with an estimated 42 million visitors annually as of

        Sanctuary, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, and Sheep Meadow;

      <h2>City Culture</h2>
      <p>
        New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world.
        The culture of New York is reflected in its size and ethnic diversity.
        Many American cultural movements first emerged in the city. Large
        numbers of Irish, Italian, Jewish, and ultimately Asian and Hispanic
        Americans also emigrated to New York throughout the 20th century,
        significantly influencing the culture and image of New York.
