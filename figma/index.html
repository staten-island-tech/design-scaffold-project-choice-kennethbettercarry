        <h2>NYC's Boroughs</h2>
        <h3>Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island</h3>
        <p>
          All five boroughs came into existence with the creation of modern New
          York City in 1898, when New York County, Kings County, part of Queens
          County, and Richmond County were consolidated within one municipal
          government under a new city charter. All former municipalities within
          the newly consolidated city were eliminated.

        <h2>Attractions</h2>
        <h3>World Trade Center</h3>
        <p>
          The building occupies a 200-foot square, with an area of 40,000 square
          feet , nearly identical to the footprints of the original Twin Towers.
          The tower is built upon a 185-foot tall windowless concrete base,
          designed to protect it from truck bombs and other ground-level
          attacks. The current base cladding consists of angled glass fins
          protruding from stainless steel panels, similar to those on 7 World
          Trade Center. LED lights behind the panels illuminate the base at
          night. Cable-net glass façades on all four sides of the building for
          the higher floors, designed by Schlaich Bergermann, will be consistent
          with the other buildings in the complex.

        <h3>The Statue Of Liberty</h3>
        <p>
          The statue is a figure of Libertas, a robed Roman liberty goddess. She
          holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand
          carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776 in
          Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A
          broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she walks forward,
          commemorating the recent national abolition of slavery. After its
          dedication, the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United
          States, seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.

        <h2>City Culture</h2>
        <p>
          New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world.
          The culture of New York is reflected in its size and ethnic diversity.
          Many American cultural movements first emerged in the city. Large
          numbers of Irish, Italian, Jewish, and ultimately Asian and Hispanic
          Americans also emigrated to New York throughout the 20th century,
          significantly influencing the culture and image of New York.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the
          Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract
          expressionism in painting; and hip hop, punk, salsa, freestyle, Tin
          Pan Alley, certain forms of jazz, and disco in music. New York has
          been considered the dance capital of the world.The city is also
          frequently the setting for novels, movies and television programs.

        <h2>Restaurants</h2>
        <h3>Peter Luger</h3>
        <p>Although a slew of Luger copycats have prospered in the last several years, none have captured the elusive charm of this stucco walled, beer-hall style eatery, with well-worn wooden floors and tables, and waiters in waist coats and bow ties. Excess is the thing, be it the reasonably health-conscious tomato salad (thick slices of tomato and onion with an odd addition of steak sauce), the famous porterhouse for two, 44 ounces of sliced prime beef, or the crisp apple strudel, which comes with a bowl full of schlag. Go for it all without hesitation — it’s a singular New York experience that’s worth having.

        <h3>Lombardi’s</h3>
        <p>Still located in the Little Italy section of Manhattan offering its beautiful, smoky-crusted coal oven baked pizza, topped with purist tomato sauce, fresh whole milk mozzarella, and basil, keeping locals and visitors alike coming back. Gennario Lombardi opened his shop in Soho in 1905—the first pizzeria in the U.S. It’s hard to vouch for how the pizzas tasted a century ago, but there’s more elbow room now after a renovation, if not the charm of the old joint. Still, Lombardi’s continues to bake a hot contender for best pie.

        <h3>Nathan’s Famous</h3>
        <p>
        The famous frank joint's Surf-and-Stillwell flagship—opened in 1916—grills sizzling hot dogs daily and hosts its iconic, crowd-amassing eating contest every July 4. The original subway tiles and iconic signage are still intact, as are menu staples like crinkle-cut fries and thick-battered corn dogs, but there’s one shiny “new” addition: a curbside clam bar, a revival of the restaurant’s raw bar from the ’50s. East Coast oysters and littlenecks are shucked per order over a mountain of ice, served with chowder crackers, lemon wedges, sinus-clearing horseradish and cocktail sauce.
