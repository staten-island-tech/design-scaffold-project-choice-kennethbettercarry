          <p>
            All five boroughs came into existence with the creation of modern
            New York City in 1898, when New York County, Kings County, part of
            Queens County, and Richmond County were consolidated within one
            municipal government under a new city charter. All former
            municipalities within the newly consolidated city were eliminated.

          <h3>World Trade Center</h3>
          <p>
            The building occupies a 200-foot square, with an area of 40,000
            square feet , nearly identical to the footprints of the original
            Twin Towers. The tower is built upon a 185-foot tall windowless
            concrete base, designed to protect it from truck bombs and other
            ground-level attacks. The current base cladding consists of angled
            glass fins protruding from stainless steel panels, similar to those
            on 7 World Trade Center. LED lights behind the panels illuminate the
            base at night. Cable-net glass façades on all four sides of the
            building for the higher floors, designed by Schlaich Bergermann,
            will be consistent with the other buildings in the complex.

          <h3>The Statue Of Liberty</h3>
          <p>
            The statue is a figure of Libertas, a robed Roman liberty goddess.
            She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her
            left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July
            4, 1776 in Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of
            Independence. A broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she
            walks forward, commemorating the recent national abolition of
            slavery. After its dedication, the statue became an icon of freedom
            and of the United States, seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants
            arriving by sea.

            West and Upper East Sides of Manhattan. It is the fifth largest park
            in the city, covering 843 acres (341 ha). It is the most visited
            urban park in the United States, with an estimated 42 million
            visitors annually as of 2016, and is the most filmed location in the
            world. Main attractions include landscapes such as the Ramble and
            Lake, Hallett Nature Sanctuary, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
            Reservoir, and Sheep Meadow; amusement attractions such as Wollman
            Rink, Central Park Carousel, and the Central Park Zoo.

            New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the
            world. The culture of New York is reflected in its size and ethnic
            diversity. Many American cultural movements first emerged in the
            city. Large numbers of Irish, Italian, Jewish, and ultimately Asian
            and Hispanic Americans also emigrated to New York throughout the
            20th century, significantly influencing the culture and image of New
            York.
          </p>
          <p>
            The city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the
            Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract
            expressionism in painting; and hip hop, punk, salsa, freestyle, Tin
            Pan Alley, certain forms of jazz, and disco in music. New York has
            been considered the dance capital of the world.The city is also
            frequently the setting for novels, movies and television programs.

          <p>
            Although a slew of Luger copycats have prospered in the last several
            years, none have captured the elusive charm of this stucco walled,
            beer-hall style eatery, with well-worn wooden floors and tables, and
            waiters in waist coats and bow ties. Excess is the thing, be it the
            reasonably health-conscious tomato salad (thick slices of tomato and
            onion with an odd addition of steak sauce), the famous porterhouse
            for two, 44 ounces of sliced prime beef, or the crisp apple strudel,
            which comes with a bowl full of schlag. Go for it all without
            hesitation — it’s a singular New York experience that’s worth
            having.

          <h3>Lombardi’s</h3>
          <p>
            Still located in the Little Italy section of Manhattan offering its
            beautiful, smoky-crusted coal oven baked pizza, topped with purist
            tomato sauce, fresh whole milk mozzarella, and basil, keeping locals
            and visitors alike coming back. Gennario Lombardi opened his shop in
            Soho in 1905—the first pizzeria in the U.S. It’s hard to vouch for
            how the pizzas tasted a century ago, but there’s more elbow room now
            after a renovation, if not the charm of the old joint. Still,
            Lombardi’s continues to bake a hot contender for best pie.

          <h3>Nathan’s Famous</h3>
          <p>
            The famous frank joint's Surf-and-Stillwell flagship—opened in
            1916—grills sizzling hot dogs daily and hosts its iconic,
            crowd-amassing eating contest every July 4. The original subway
            tiles and iconic signage are still intact, as are menu staples like
            crinkle-cut fries and thick-battered corn dogs, but there’s one
            shiny “new” addition: a curbside clam bar, a revival of the
            restaurant’s raw bar from the ’50s. East Coast oysters and
            littlenecks are shucked per order over a mountain of ice, served
            with chowder crackers, lemon wedges, sinus-clearing horseradish and
            cocktail sauce.

          <h3>Katz’s Delicatessen</h3>
          <p>
            This cavernous cafeteria is a repository of New York
            history—glossies of celebs spanning the past century crowd the
            walls, and the classic Jewish deli offerings are nonpareil. Start
            with a crisp-skinned, all-beef hot dog for less than a fiver. Then
            flag down a meat cutter and order one of the legendary sandwiches.
            The brisket sings with horseradish, and the thick-cut pastrami
            stacked high between slices of rye is the stuff of dreams.
            Everything tastes better with a glass of the hoppy house lager; if
            you’re on the wagon, make it a Dr. Brown’s.

          <h3>Totonno’s</h3>
          <p>
            Totonno was an employee at the Lombardi's pizzeria on Spring Street
            in New York's Little Italy that was established in 1905 when he
            began selling tomato pies cooked in a coal oven and wrapped in paper
            and tied with a string. In 1924, Totonno left Lombardi's to open his
            own pizzeria on Coney Island called Totonno's. At Totonno’s—a Coney
            Island beacon since Anthony Pero opened its doors in 1924—the pizza
            de résistance is the top-notch white pie. Sand-dusted pizza lovers
            make the trek from the beach for the off-menu garlicky round: It’s
            covered in gleaming white house-made mozzarella and pecorino romano,
            leopard-spotted with crispy char marks.

          <h3>Tavern on the Green</h3>
          <p>
            For 75 years, the gilded dining room nestled inside Central Park was
            a New York hallmark, a scenic magnet for tourists, brides and
            megawatt diners (Grace Kelly, John Lennon) alike. When the
            razzle-dazzle cash cow went bankrupt and shuttered in 2010, big-name
            backers expressed interest in reviving the historic space. Instead,
            a pair of Philadelphia crepe-makers won the bid. The pair revamped
            the landmark as an urban farmhouse decorated with wood-beam
            ceilings, leather-covered tables and multiple hearths.

          <h3>Bacon Egg and Cheese</h3>
          <p>
            Arguably New York’s most famous sandwich is the bacon egg and
            cheese, otherwise known as a BEC. People order them on everything
            froms rolls to bagels to heros at their local deli down the block.
            The bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich has become such an integral part
            of New York bodega culture, that it's basically one word. You say it
            all together: baconeggandcheese. That's why, if you were in a
            bodega, you might hear someone order it in a way that sounds rushed,
            like this: “Can I get a baconeggandcheese, please?”

          <h3>New York Styled Pizzas</h3>
          <p>
            New York–style pizza is pizza made with a characteristically large
            hand-tossed thin crust, often sold in wide slices to go. The crust
            is thick and crisp only along its edge, yet soft, thin, and pliable
            enough beneath its toppings to be folded in half to eat. Traditional
            toppings are simply tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese. You
            can find these at local pizzaerias anywhere, especially in Brooklyn
            and Manhattan where they are prefereably the best and most
            unhealthy.

          <h3>Pastrami</h3>
          <p>
            New York pastrami is generally made from the navel end of the beef
            brisket. The raw meat cut is cured in brine in a mixture of salt,
            sugar, and spices for up to a week, then dried and coated with a mix
            of spices including garlic, coriander, black pepper, paprika,
            cloves, allspice, and mustard seed. Pastrami on rye is New York's
            signature sandwich and a staple of many Jewish delis. This simple
            sandwich traditionally consists of delicate pastrami slices that are
            placed on rye bread, then topped with spicy mustard, and the whole
            thing is typically accompanied by kosher dill pickles on the side.
